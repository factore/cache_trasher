cache_trasher: You have attempted to remove your entire public directory.  
If you want the ability to clear your entire cache directory, you will need to change
the directory that your application stores cached pages in.  You can do this by adding
config.action_controller.page_cache_directory = RAILS_ROOT+"/public/<your-dir-name>/" 
to environment.rb.  For more information, see the cache_trasher documentation.
