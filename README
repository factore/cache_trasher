cache_trasher
============

When using page caching, often you'll need to expire several pages in several locations at once.  cache_trasher provides a simple method for bulk-deleting cached pages via action, controller, or direct path.

Example
=======

cache_trasher should be used in place of expire_page in your cache sweepers.

  class PageSweeper < ActionController::Caching::Sweeper
    observe Page
    
    def after_save(page)
      # deletes public/pages and public/pages.html (if it exists)
      trash_cache(:controller => "pages")
      
      # deletes public/pages/view and public/pages/view.html (if it exists)
      trash_cache(:controller => "pages", :action => "view")
      
      # deletes public/pages/index.html
      trash_cache("index")
      
      # deletes your entire cache provided config.action_controller.page_cache_directory is not your public directory
      trashes_cache()
    end
  end

Note that trash_cache will never delete your entire public directory or everything in your public directory.  However, it will delete pretty much anything else you tell it to regardless of whether or not it's actually a cached file, so be careful!
